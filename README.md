# Facial_Emotion_Detection_CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for facial emotion detection, enabling real-time analysis of emotions through a laptop's camera. Leveraging CNN layers, the model is trained on a Kaggle dataset, enabling it to accurately detect facial expressions with an average accuracy ranging between 70-72 percent.

# Features:
1.CNN Model: Utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNN layers, for robust facial emotion recognition.
2.Real-time Detection: Employs OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using the laptop's camera, allowing immediate analysis of facial expressions.
3.Kaggle Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive Kaggle dataset, ensuring diverse and extensive training data for accurate emotion recognition.

# Applications:
1.Healthcare 
2.Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
3.Security and Surveillance
4.DDA(Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment) games
